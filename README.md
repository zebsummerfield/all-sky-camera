# all-sky-camera
This code was developed during my internship at Durham University's Physics department.

I was responsible for setting up an all sky camera to run off a raspberry pi for the purpose of identifying which stars on the night sky are visible. these files take and modify captures using the INDI library.

This guide was used for installation of the libraries and provided the basis for some of the scripts.
